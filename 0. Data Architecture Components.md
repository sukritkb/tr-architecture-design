# Modern Data Architecture

## Introduction

When choosing an architecture, it's important to optimise for technical features such as scalability, high availability, disaster recovery, cost efficiency, performance optimisation, and security and governance. It should also align with business requirements, enabling self-service capabilities and data democratisation to empower data-driven decision-making. Additionally, it should also consider the skill sets of the end users and the in-house expertise available to support the architecture.

## Data Architecture Components and Requirements

1. **Data Storage and Scalability**
   - Use scalable, tiered storage (data lakehouse) to handle diverse data types and growth efficiently.

2. **Data Integration and Interoperability**
   - Leverage managed ETL/ELT services and APIs for seamless, real-time data integration across systems.

3. **Data Quality and Governance (Data Ops)**
   - Creating frameworks for automated data quality checks, lineage tracking, and centralised governance.

4. **Security and Compliance**
   - Ensure robust security with cloud IAM, encryption, and compliance with regulatory standards like GDPR.

5. **Data Cataloging and Discovery**
   - Use data catalogs to improve discoverability and context of data assets for self-service.

6. **Data Processing and Compute Strategy**
   - Opt for serverless and decoupled compute options to scale independently and minimise operational costs.

7. **Data Modeling and Schema Management**
   - Enable schema flexibility with schema-on-read and optimise for analytics to enhance performance.

8. **Data Access and Analytics Enablement**
   - Provide self-service analytics tools and data virtualisation for accessible, unified data views.

9. **Cost Management and Optimisation**
   - Use cloud cost management tools and automated storage tiering to control expenses efficiently.

10. **Observability and Monitoring**
    - Implement native monitoring to track pipeline health, data reliability, and quickly resolve issues.
