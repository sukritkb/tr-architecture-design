## Problem Statement

- ### **Operational Challenges:**
  - Poor performance during high-traffic periods, including SQL deadlocks.
  - Suboptimal read and write operations leading to degraded user experience.

- ### **Scalability Issues:**
  - Increasing demand for data analysis, ingestion, and consumption by analysts, data scientists, and customers.
  - Current architecture unable to support growing business and data needs effectively.

- ### **Architecture Requirements:**
  - Need for a future-proof and scalable data architecture to address operational bottlenecks.
  - Ability to support both internal operations and external customer-facing processes.

- ### **Data Processing Demands:**
  - Integration of both OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) workloads.
  - Management of a high volume of scheduled and continuous processes interacting with a primary SQL Server database.

- ### **Assignment Goals:**
  - Design a scalable data architecture with appropriate tools and vendor choices.
  - Provide a detailed plan for data ingestion processes with tooling proposals.
  - Justify architectural decisions with a comprehensive rationale.
  - Deliver a proof-of-concept implementation for the proposed data ingestion process.
