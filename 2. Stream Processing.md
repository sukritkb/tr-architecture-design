## Implementation Details

The goal with this architecture is to replace ***"continously"*** running jobs which directly query the SQL databases.

### Step-by-Step Configuration and Setup

1. **Setting Up Change Data Capture (CDC) on the OLTP Database**:
   - **Enable CDC**: Configure Change Data Capture (CDC) on the OLTP SQL Server database to capture inserts, updates, and deletes. 
   - **Configure Data Flow to Event Hubs**: Use **Azure Data Factory (ADF) Mapping Data Flow** or **native SQL Server CDC** capabilities to stream CDC changes to Event Hubs.
   - **Event Schema**: Structure events in JSON format, containing key fields (such as operation type, timestamp, and record ID) to track changes.

2. **Configuring Azure Event Hubs**:
   - **Create Event Hub Namespace and Instance**: Set up an Event Hub instance to handle incoming CDC data.
   - **Partition Strategy**: Configure partitions in Event Hubs to handle expected data throughput. Partitioning enables parallel processing and improves read performance for Spark.
   - **Data Retention Policy**: Set retention policies based on data consumption frequency. This ensures data is available for reprocessing if necessary.

3. **Setting Up Synapse Spark Pools for Stream Processing**:
   - **Structured Streaming in Spark**: Use Synapse Spark Pools to read data from Event Hubs using Spark’s Structured Streaming API.
   - **Event Processing Logic**: Implement transformation logic in Spark to filter, deduplicate, and format events. For example, consolidate inserts and updates into a final “upsert” state before writing to Cosmos DB.
   - **Error Handling**: Implement error handling and logging for transformation errors and data inconsistencies within the Spark job, ensuring resilience and troubleshooting support.
   - **Batch and Trigger Intervals**: Configure batch intervals in Spark Structured Streaming for real-time responsiveness without overwhelming Cosmos DB or other downstream systems.

4. **Configuring Cosmos DB for Real-Time Data Storage** (Thinking of Cosmos as Cassandra):
   - **Database and Collection Setup**: Set up Cosmos DB with collections to store the final data state.
   - **Partition Key Design**: Choose partition keys to optimise performance based on expected query patterns. For example, if most queries are by customer ID, consider using customer ID as the partition key.
   - **Consistency Model**: Use a consistency level that balances read latency with accuracy, such as **Session Consistency** for most real-time use cases, ensuring predictable performance.
   - **Indexing Policy**: Customise indexing in Cosmos DB to optimise for query speed and cost, indexing only required fields.

## Monitoring and Management Considerations

1. **Monitoring CDC and Event Hubs**:
   - **Azure Monitor**: Use **Azure Monitor** to track latency, throughput, and error rates for CDC processes and Event Hubs. Set alerts on lag times or dropped events to ensure data freshness.
   - **Event Hub Metrics**: Monitor Event Hub throughput, partition load, and lag to identify any bottlenecks or need for scaling. Enable alerts for high throughput or when partitions approach capacity limits.

2. **Spark Job Monitoring and Tuning**:
   - **Spark Structured Streaming Metrics**: Monitor batch duration, processing time, and trigger intervals to ensure the Spark job processes events within expected SLAs.
   - **Autoscaling**: Set Spark Pools to autoscale based on event volume, ensuring cost-efficiency during low-load periods and responsiveness during high-load periods.
   - **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement detailed logging for Spark jobs to track processing errors, and configure alerts for any prolonged failures. Store logs in **Azure Log Analytics** for easier analysis.

3. **Cosmos DB Monitoring and Optimisation**:
   - **Latency and RU Consumption**: Use Cosmos DB metrics to monitor read/write latency and **Request Units (RUs)** consumption, adjusting partition keys and scaling as needed.
   - **Indexing and Query Optimisation**: Regularly review indexing policies and query performance in Cosmos DB to ensure efficient data access for real-time applications.

## Summary

This real-time infrastructure in Azure Synapse offers a scalable, Azure-native solution for handling CDC data, transforming it in real time, and storing it in Cosmos DB for fast, low-latency access. By leveraging **Azure Event Hubs** and **Synapse Spark Pools** for streaming, the architecture efficiently handles high-velocity data with near real-time updates, reducing the burden on OLTP systems and enabling responsive analytics. 

While Databricks offers advanced features like Delta Lake for real-time processing, the Azure Synapse-based design chosen here emphasises close integration with the Azure ecosystem, cost efficiency, and flexibility. This architecture provides a foundation for expanding into real-time analytics, machine learning, and hybrid batch-streaming use cases in the future.

This design allows for flexibility, scalability, and operational efficiency, aligning with business needs for a robust, integrated, and Azure-native real-time processing solution.

**Note**: Although I haven’t implemented this architecture in Azure (i.e in my current role) --, I have built similar real-time streaming architectures at my previous organisations. In those environments, I used **Databricks** with continuously running Spark clusters to read data streams from **Kafka clusters**, process and calculate real-time metrics, and write results back to Kafka topics or store it in **Cassandra tables** for real-time analytics for a customer segmentation platform. This Azure-based architecture leverages similar principles but is designed to take advantage of Azure-native services.
